# Dependabot configuration file
# Mirrors the behavior of the existing Renovate configuration (github>mi11er-net/renovate-config)
#
# Renovate features translated:
# - Weekly schedule for lock file maintenance → weekly npm schedule
# - Group devDependencies into "All Dev" → grouped updates for development dependencies
# - CircleCI automerge on Monday morning → GitHub Actions weekly schedule (automerge not directly supported)
# - :prHourlyLimit4 → open-pull-requests-limit
# - :rebaseStalePrs → rebase-strategy: auto
#
# Differences from Renovate:
# - Dependabot doesn't support automatic PR automerge (requires GitHub Actions workflow)
# - Dependabot grouping is different - uses "groups" feature
# - Dependabot doesn't distinguish between regular updates and lock file maintenance
# - Dependabot doesn't have :prNotPending equivalent (waiting for CI before creating PRs)
# - Peer dependency widening (:widenPeerDependencies) is not supported
